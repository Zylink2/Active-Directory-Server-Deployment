## Objective

The project aimed to build AD DS which can be used to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to understanding components of Active Directory, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Note
1. No antivirus is run on the domain. This is just a basic simulation of the AD attack which will be picking up by antivirus
2. Local admin here is enabled. In most cases, best practice is to disable it

### Skills Learned

- Better understanding in Active Directory in the internal network.
- Engagement with Group policies.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tool Used

- Oracle Virtual Box
